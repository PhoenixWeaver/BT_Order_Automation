## 💡 Why This Tool Exists

> **Do you have hundreds of cases and templates to manage every day?**
> **Do you need hundreds of notes and pages just to keep your templates organized?**
> **Do you need to remember hundreds of scenarios and cases by heart?**

You shouldn't have to.

The **Quantum Processor Case Library** was built for exactly this problem. Instead of digging through folders, scrolling through shared docs, or memorizing which template fits which scenario — everything lives in one place, instantly searchable, always ready to copy.

One tool. Every template. Zero memory required.

## 🚀 Overview

The **DEMO blank templates Case Library** is a self-contained web tool designed to streamline the handling of Logistic PickUp cases. It serves as a centralized, interactive repository of pre-written email templates and internal notes covering every common customer service scenario.

Core goals:
- **Standardize Communication** — Every agent sends consistent, approved messaging.
- **Increase Efficiency** — Find and send the right response in seconds, not minutes.
- **Reduce Errors** — Clear, editable templates eliminate copy-paste mistakes.
- **Personalize at Scale** — Edit and permanently save your own version of any template.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Library Switching
- **Special Cases** — Bilingual templates (Vietnamese + English) for cross-region cases.
- **The Scenarios** — The complete collection of all the scenario templates.
- **Pop cases** — Templates tailored specifically for the Vietnam region.

### 2. Category Sidebar Navigation
- Filter templates instantly by category: `UNREACHED`, `DOCS`, `CMOD`, `ESCALATED`, `PUP STATUS`, and more.
- Each category displays a live count of templates inside it.

### 3. Live Search
- Real-time filtering as you type — search by template **ID**, **title**, or any **word inside the body or note**.
- No need to know the exact name. Type a keyword and the right template surfaces immediately.

### 4. Dual-Language Templates
- Many templates carry both Vietnamese and English in a single card body.
- One copy action delivers both languages — no switching, no extra steps.

### 5. Inline Quick Editing
- Click directly inside any **Customer Email** or **Internal Note** field to make quick, one-off edits before copying.
- Replace placeholders like `[AWB Number]` or `[NEW AWB]` on the fly without entering edit mode.

### 6. Separate Copy Buttons
- **Copy Email** — Copies the customer-facing response. Disabled automatically for `[Internal Note Only]` cards.
- **Copy Note** — Copies the internal note for pasting into GSP, team chats, or case logs.

## 🖊️ Edit, Save & Reset Templates

This is the most powerful feature of the Case Library. You are not locked into the default templates — you can **permanently customize them** to match your team's exact language, tone, and workflow.

### ✏️ Edit Templates

Click the **✏️ Edit Templates** button in the top-right toolbar to enter Edit Mode.

- Every **Customer Email** body and **Internal Note** across all visible cards becomes fully editable.
- The button turns red and changes to **🚫 Stop Editing** to clearly signal you are in edit mode.
- The **💾 Save Templates** and **↩ Reset** buttons appear automatically alongside it.
- Make any changes you need — reword sentences, update contact details, add your team's signature, remove sections that don't apply.
- Click **🚫 Stop Editing** again to exit edit mode without saving.

*Edit Mode active — all email bodies and internal notes become fully editable directly on the card.*

> **Tip:** You can still use the search bar and category sidebar while in edit mode to navigate to the template you want to change.

---

### 💾 Save Templates

Click **💾 Save Templates** to permanently save all your edits for the current library.

- Edits are saved to your browser's **`localStorage`** — they survive page refreshes, browser restarts, and computer reboots.
- Saves are **per library** — edits to `The Scenarios` do not affect `Pop cases` or `Special Cases`.
- A **✅ Saved!** confirmation flashes on the button so you know it worked.
- The next time you open the page, your saved versions load automatically — the defaults are replaced with your customized text.

**What gets saved:**

| Content | Saved? |
|---|---|
| Customer Email body | ✅ Yes |
| Internal Note text | ✅ Yes |
| Card title / ID | ✅ Used as identifier |
| Library selection | ✅ Per library |

> **Storage:** `localStorage` is browser-local. Edits are saved on your machine only and are not shared with other users or devices.

---

### ↩ Reset Templates

Click **↩ Reset** to discard all saved edits for the current library and restore the original defaults.

- A confirmation dialog appears before anything is deleted — no accidental resets.
- Only the **current library** is reset. Other libraries keep their saved edits.
- The page reloads automatically with the original default templates restored.

> **Use this when:** A template has been updated in the source file and you want to pull in the new default, or when you want to start your customization fresh.

---

```
1. Open the Case Library
2. Switch to the library you want to customize (e.g. The Scenarios)
